"description":"BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from licensed therapists and counselors online. With over 3000 trained, experienced and accredited counselors covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 3000 counselors & therapists with different areas of expertise\n• All counselors are licensed, trained, accredited and highly experienced\n• Match with an available counselor who is the best fit for your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your counselor or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars \n\n\nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\n\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional counselor has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. \n\n\nLICENSED AND TRAINED COUNSELORS & THERAPISTS\n\nThere are over 3000 counselors in BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials. \n\nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective field. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board are completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice. \n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nYou and your counselor will get your own secure “room”. This will be your private place to communicate day or night. You can access this room from any internet connected device, wherever you are. \n\nYou can write about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you’re facing. Your counselor will login to the same room and respond with feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your counselor. \n\nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals and overcoming your problems. \n\n\nHOW MANY SESSIONS CAN I HAVE?\n\nYou aren’t limited to a certain number of messages (“sessions”). The frequency of your sessions depends on your availability and the interaction between you and your counselor. You may prefer to have 3-4 short interactions per week, or 1 very long and thorough session. You can use the service as much or as little as you like, depending on your needs. Your therapist will work to accommodate your changing needs in a timely manner. \n\n\n\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\n\nMany people avoid getting professional help because it can become extremely expensive. We want to make BetterHelp easy and accessible to everyone, so we've created a plan which is simple, predictable, risk-free, and affordable.\n\nPlans range from as low as $40 per week. With any plan you choose, you will pay a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling.\n\nIf you accomplished your goals or if you found it to be no longer helpful for any reason, you can simply cancel the subscription. Canceling is easy and done online - there are no hoops to jump through.\n\n\nYOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.\n\nWE ARE HERE TO HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN – DOWNLOAD BETTERHELP TODAY!", "artistId":995252383, "artistName":"BetterHelp", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price":0.00, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2020-03-03T17:50:47Z", "bundleId":"com.ionicframework.betterhelp369708", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":10908},

"description":"***** (5/5)  \"Word Wow is an explosion of thought-provoking, perplexing, and thrilling fun for almost all ages.\" - AppAdvice\n\nWord Wow is a word game where you make words to dig deeper into the ground. As you dig down, the worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly (although a no-timer mode is available) to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find the worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As the worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.    Help a worm out! \n\nFeatures: \n* Fast action with the timer or relaxed mode without it\n* More than 440+ Levels and 21 different worlds \n* Bonus level for each world when  you collect all the gems\n* Lots of replay value as you see your ranking against all other players globally", "artistId":602002945, "artistName":"DonkeySoft Inc.", "genres":["Games", "Word", "Entertainment", "Puzzle"], "price":0.00, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2020-02-25T23:55:39Z", "bundleId":"com.donkeysoft.wordwow", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":6941},

Although not text-heavy, users will need to study the guidance to get the best out of SAM. Users are encouraged to build their own Anxiety Toolkit of SAM resources that they find helpful and to draw on this for regular practice in managing situations that are associated with anxiety.   \n\nSAM may be used with or without the support of a registered health practitioner but you may wish to consult with your local health or well-being practitioner if you are uncertain about using SAM.", "artistId":548085225, "artistName":"University of the West of England", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price":0.00, "currentVersionReleaseDate":"2017-02-21T19:54:05Z", "bundleId":"uk.ac.uwe.sam", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":173},

"description":"This is the stop smoking app that science built. Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.\n\nWeekly Subscription\nIf you choose to subscribe you get access to all elements of the app. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase  and subscriptions automatically renew each week unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
