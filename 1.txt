"description":"** Apple's Best of 2017 **\n\nStress, anxiety, and depression can get in the way of you living your life. Pacifica gives you psychologist-designed tools to address them based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, mindfulness meditation, relaxation, and mood/health tracking.\n\nStress, anxiety, and depression are caused by an ongoing cycle of negative thoughts. Thoughts cause physical feelings and emotions which cause actions. Pacifica helps break this cycle using tools that target each of its components. Day-by-day, you'll learn to manage stress, anxiety and depression at your own pace. We’re not about quick-fixes or false promises. We are about real progress, a day at a time.\n\n#1 - BuzzFeed's Amazing Apps For Anyone Living With Anxiety\n#1 - Forbes' 4 Technologies Innovating in Mental Health\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\n\"This app is not only beautiful and easy to use, it's also an incredibly useful tool that has genuinely changed my way of thinking when it comes to anxiety.\"\n\n“Thank you so much for improving my quality of life. I suffer from depression and generalized anxiety disorder and your app helps me SO much!...I know I can do better and Pacifica motivates me to improve my eating habits (and to drink more water and less alcohol and coffee!).”\n\nRELAXATION & MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AUDIO TOOLS\nCalm down in moments of stress or anxiety using one of Pacifica’s 30+ audio exercises set to relaxing soundscapes, including deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditations, and more.\n\nGUIDED SELF-HELP PATHS\nOur psychologist-designed Paths include audio lessons and helpful activities to help you with stress, anxiety, or depression. These include an introductory Path, two Paths focused on CBT, and a mindfulness Path.\n\nMOOD TRACKER\nRate your mood and feelings throughout the day, and add specific notes (the situation, the trigger, etc.) so you can notice patterns and see improvement over time. \n\nTHOUGHT RECORDING, JOURNALING & ANALYSIS\nUse Pacifica’s psychologist-designed thought analysis tools to learn how distorted thinking patterns contribute to your anxiety. Pacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to think in a more balanced way, which helps break the negative thought cycle.\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES & GOAL TRACKING\nPacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to face your anxiety, one day at a time, and gradually work toward your long term goals via daily challenges.\n\nHEALTH TRACKER\nSet and track daily health goals for habits that affect anxiety (exercise, sleep, caffeine, alcohol, etc.). Learn which of these trigger your anxiety based on patterns in your mood. Exercise, sleep and caffeine can also be populated using the Apple Health app.\n\nCOMMUNITIES & GROUPS\nYou aren’t alone in this.

"description":"***** (5/5)  \"Word Wow is an explosion of thought-provoking, perplexing, and thrilling fun for almost all ages.\" - AppAdvice\n\nWord Wow is a word game where you make words to dig deeper into the ground. As you dig down, Worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly (although a no-timer mode is available) to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find Worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As Worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.    Help a worm out! \n\nFeatures: \n* 140,000 word dictionary \n* Fast action with the timer or relaxed mode without it\n* 240 Levels and 12 distinct worlds \n* Bonus level for each world when  you collect all the gems\n* Lots of replay value as you try to compete with others in Game Center", "artistId":602002945, "artistName":"DonkeySoft Inc.", "genres":["Games", "Word", "Entertainment", "Puzzle"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.donkeysoft.wordwow", "genreIds":["6014", "7019", "6016", "7012"], "formattedPrice":"Free", "minimumOsVersion":"8.0", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":3879},

"description":"This is the stop smoking app that science built. Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.\n\nWeekly Subscription\nIf you choose to subscribe you get access to all elements of the app. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase  and subscriptions automatically renew each week unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. The subscription costs 99p (or local equivalent) per week. You can manage your subscriptions in the iPhone Settings app and you can turn off auto-renew by going to your Account Settings .Any unused portion of a free trial period will be forfeited when you purchases a subscription, where applicable.

I think these two things are very effective because they make the student feel like they are actually studying and not wasting time.” - Student, Calgary, Alberta, Canada\n\n“This program takes the frustration out of math because it allows the student to practice at his/her own pace and stay focused. It's okay if you mark one wrong because another one will be waiting. This is a great tool to have.” - Parent of a 4th grader, California, U.S.A.\n\n“We like the rewards and certificates; our children work very hard to receive these! The reports are also brilliant in keeping us informed of the levels our children have reached and where they need extra help.” - Parent, Coolah, NSW, Australia\n\n“My students are improving by the day, and some even stay in for recess to work on IXL!” - Helm Jackson, 5th grade teacher, Redmond, Washington, U.S.A.\n\nIXL Membership\n\nBecome an IXL member for $19.99 per month and you’ll get access to a fully personalized learning experience - complete with comprehensive curriculum and guidance, meaningful analytics, and fun awards and milestones!  \n\nPricing may vary by country.

"description":"*** One of the best educational apps of the year - Apple (iTunes Rewind) ***\nNow you can learn to speak & read Spanish, all by playing games on the go. With 9 addictive games designed for essential vocabulary & conversation skills, MindSnacks’ Spanish app is perfect for adults, kids, students or globetrotters visiting any Spanish-speaking country.\n\nBy playing rich and engaging games instead of flipping tedious flashcards, you’ll actually enjoy learning our app’s 1000+ Spanish vocab words.

It includes complex exercises, challenges, and lessons that make the learning process fun and effective.\"\n\n* FEATURES * \n\n-- 9 addictive and unique games\n-- 1000+ Spanish words & phrases to study and master\n-- Spoken audio clips provided by a native Spanish speaker to help with pronunciation\n-- Hand-illustrated image library to help memorize words\n-- 50 Spanish lessons designed by Ivy League instructors (upgrade required)\n-- Personalized learning algorithms to maximize memorization, retention & contextual usage\n-- Enhanced review mode lets you replay previously mastered lessons\n-- Additional quests & challenges will keep you motivated\n-- Not a single tedious, boring, mind-numbing or snooze-inducing quiz, class or lesson allowed\n\n* WHAT OUR (SUPER AWESOME) FANS HAVE TO SAY *\n\n“I highly recommend this to those of you that want a quick, easy, and on-the-go way to learn Spanish!”\n\n“I recently stumbled upon MindSnacks as an app for use with my students who are learning Spanish. What a gem! The game-based structure makes learning fun and exciting while also being motivational.”\n\n“I just downloaded how to speak Spanish and ended up getting all the languages because it’s so easy and it is a great way to learn new languages. It's fun too!”\n\n* THE SCIENCE BEHIND MINDSNACKS *\n\nAt MindSnacks we like to keep it fun, but we’re serious about learning. That’s why our Spanish app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific aspect of the language, creating a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes far beyond basic vocabulary flashcards. \n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Spanish words, phrases and grammatical points with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Spanish, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience. \n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Latin American Spanish, MindSnacks is like your own personal Spanish teacher you can take just about anywhere . You’ll quickly become less reliant on that Spanish dictionary and learn the grammar and vocab needed for traveling in Spain or other Spanish-speaking countries. \n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.
