"description":"The #1 app for stress, anxiety, and depression \n\nSymptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression often arise when least expected. With Sanvello, you’ll always have the right tools a tap away to relieve symptoms and feel better. Formerly Pacifica, Sanvello offers clinically validated strategies and support to help you feel happier over time. \n\n \nHOW IT WORKS: \nSanvello is an evidence-based solution created by psychologists that uses clinically validated techniques such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)—a type of psychotherapy that has been shown to be especially effective for stress, anxiety, and depression.  \n\nSanvello teaches you CBT through immersive journeys that combine videos, audio exercises, activities, mood and health habit tracking, and activities. The powerful techniques you’ll learn are designed to work together to help you learn how to feel happier.  \n\n \n\nTHE SCIENCE BEHIND SANVELLO: \nSanvello is rooted in widely-used and empirically-supported treatments for anxiety, depression, and stress. Numerous studies show these practices to be effective in addressing a variety of psychological disorders that get in the way of living a happy life. \n\nIn a randomized, wait-listed controlled study of 500 adults, Sanvello was shown to decrease symptoms of anxiety and depression over the course of 30 days. Participants also reported increased self-efficacy and showed sustained improvement after 30 days—even after participants stopped using the app.  \n \n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET: \n\nDaily Mood Tracking: Relieving stress, anxiety, or depression starts with noting how you feel. Sanvello mood tracking, daily reminders, and health tracking tools guide you to monitor your emotions, see positive and negative influences, and make changes that can help. \n \n\nGuided Journeys: Designed by psychologists for a range of needs, Sanvello Guided Journeys are step-by-step audio lessons and activities based on CBT and other proven techniques. Choose your path to gain insight and build life skills. \n \n\nTools: When feelings or life situations get in the way of your happiness, Sanvello helps you change your outlook and get on a better path with tools to calm your mind and ways to redirect negative thoughts. \n \n\nAssessments: A key part of CBT is understanding how actions and feelings are related. Based on your mood data, Sanvello progress assessments show you connections between your experiences, activities, and emotions.  \n \n\nCommunity: At the heart of Sanvello is our vibrant community of users. See what people are posting across a wide range of topics, from personal strategies to words of encouragement. \n \n\nApple Health Integration: Health tracking for exercise, sleep, and caffeine can be populated using Apple Health. Sanvello will also write Mindfulness Minutes back to Apple Health based on your meditation usage.  \n \n\nSUBSCRIPTION PRICING & TERMS: \n \nSanvello is free to download and use. The premium version of Sanvello allows for unlimited use of all tools and is available through an auto-renewing subscription through two options: \n\n$8.99 per month \n$53.99 per year \n\nPricing in countries other than the U.S. may vary, and actual charges may be converted to your local currency depending on your country's residence. \n\nPayment will be charged to your Apple account at confirmation of purchase. Your subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the current period ends. Your Apple account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period at the price listed above. You can turn off auto-renew at any time from your Apple account settings but refunds will not be provided for the unused portion of the term. If a free trial period is offered, it will be forfeited as soon as your purchase is confirmed. \n\nTerms of Service: https://sanvello.com/tos/ \n\nPrivacy Policy: https://sanvello.com/privacy-policy/ \n \nHelp: https://help.sanvello.com or info@sanvello.com", "artistId":922968860, "artistName":"Sanvello Health Inc.", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Medical"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.pacificalabs.pacifica", "version":"8.5.0", "wrapperType":"software", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":6082},

"description":"BetterHelp is the convenient way to get professional help from licensed therapists and counselors online. With over 3000 trained, experienced and accredited counselors covering a wide range of areas – from depression and anxiety to family and couples therapy – it’s never been easier to receive personal, professional help when you need it. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------\nBETTERHELP – FEATURES\n-------------------------------------------\n• Over 3000 counselors & therapists with different areas of expertise\n• All counselors are licensed, trained, accredited and highly experienced\n• Match with an available counselor who is the best fit for your needs\n• Unlimited private one on one communication with your therapist\n• Schedule live sessions with your counselor or use the secure messenger\n• Gain access to constructive, educational group webinars \n\n\nPROFESSIONAL HELP, PERSONALIZED FOR YOU\n\nFacing obstacles alone can be daunting – receiving support and guidance from a professional counselor has been shown to make huge, positive changes to help you overcome personal challenges. When you sign up we’ll match you to an available counselor who fits your objectives, preferences and the type of issues you’re dealing with. Different counselors have different approaches and areas of expertise so we’ll work with you to find the right person who can achieve the best results for you. \n\n\nLICENSED AND TRAINED COUNSELORS & THERAPISTS\n\nThere are over 3000 counselors in BetterHelp, each with at least 3 years and 2,000 hours of hands-on experience. They are licensed, trained, experienced and accredited psychologists (PhD/PsyD), marriage and family therapists (MFT), clinical social workers (LCSW), licensed professional counselors (LPC), or similar credentials. \n\nAll of our therapists have a Master’s Degree or a Doctorate Degree in their respective field. They have been qualified and certified by their state professional board are completing the necessary education, exams, training and practice. \n\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nYou and your counselor will get your own secure “room”. This will be your private place to communicate day or night. You can access this room from any internet connected device, wherever you are. \n\nYou can write about yourself, the things going on in your life, ask questions and discuss the challenges you’re facing. Your counselor will login to the same room and respond with feedback, insights and guidance. This ongoing one-on-one dialogue is the foundation of your work with your counselor. \n\nTogether you’ll work towards making a positive change in your life, accomplishing your goals and overcoming your problems. \n\n\nHOW MANY SESSIONS CAN I HAVE?\n\nYou aren’t limited to a certain number of messages (“sessions”). The frequency of your sessions depends on your availability and the interaction between you and your counselor. You may prefer to have 3-4 short interactions per week, or 1 very long and thorough session. You can use the service as much or as little as you like, depending on your needs. Your therapist will work to accommodate your changing needs in a timely manner. \n\n\n\n\nHOW MUCH DOES IT COST?\n\nMany people avoid getting professional help because it can become extremely expensive. We want to make BetterHelp easy and accessible to everyone, so we've created a plan which is simple, predictable, risk-free, and affordable.\n\nPlans range from as low as $40 per week. With any plan you choose, you will pay a fraction of the cost of traditional counseling.\n\nIf you accomplished your goals or if you found it to be no longer helpful for any reason, you can simply cancel the subscription. Canceling is easy and done online - there are no hoops to jump through.\n\n\nYOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.\n\nWE ARE HERE TO HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN – DOWNLOAD BETTERHELP TODAY!", "artistId":995252383, "artistName":"BetterHelp", "genres":["Health & Fitness", "Lifestyle"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.ionicframework.betterhelp369708", "version":"8.2", "wrapperType":"software", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":9383},

"description":"***** (5/5)  \"Word Wow is an explosion of thought-provoking, perplexing, and thrilling fun for almost all ages.\" - AppAdvice\n\nWord Wow is a word game where you make words to dig deeper into the ground. As you dig down, the worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly (although a no-timer mode is available) to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find the worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As the worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.

"description":"This is the stop smoking app that science built. Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.\n\nWeekly Subscription\nIf you choose to subscribe you get access to all elements of the app. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the confirmation of purchase  and subscriptions automatically renew each week unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.

Because they practice the skills daily, and because the site provides feedback, students are able to correct their mistakes and master the concepts easily.” - Waleska Batista, teacher, Cherry Hill, New Jersey, U.S.A.\n\n“My favourite feature of IXL is that if you get a question wrong IXL will tell you how to solve it and what you did wrong. Another thing I really enjoy is that IXL provides awards and progress reports showing how you do over time. I think these two things are very effective because they make the student feel like they are actually studying and not wasting time.” - Student, Calgary, Alberta, Canada\n\n“This program takes the frustration out of math because it allows the student to practice at his/her own pace and stay focused.

Be My Eyes connects blind and low vision users with sighted volunteers or company representatives who can assist them with a range of tasks.\n\nBlind and low vision users can request help from a sighted volunteer, who is notified on their phone. As soon as the first volunteer accepts the request for help, a live audio-video connection is established between the two parties. Through the blind or low vision user’s rear-facing camera, the volunteer can see the item or subject the user needs assistance with and provide the visual description he or she needs.\n\nAs a blind or low vision user, you can request assistance through Be My Eyes at any time of the day, from anywhere in the world, in more than 180 languages. Be My Eyes connects you to a sighted volunteer who speaks your language and can help you with anything from simple tasks, like checking expiry dates, to more complicated situations, like navigation or finding a lost item. \n\nWith the Specialized Help feature, you can receive help directly from our partner companies if you have issues or questions regarding their specific products or services. Just tap the Specialized Help option and choose a company from the menu to call through Be My Eyes. You will be directly connected to a company representative through a live video connection. \n\nAs a sighted volunteer, you’ll receive a notification when a blind or low vision user requires some assistance. The first volunteer to answer the request will be connected to the blind or low vision user, so don’t worry if you’re not able to answer the call, another volunteer will step in instead. Be My Eyes only takes a few minutes of your time, making it easy to fit into any schedule and make a real difference in another person’s day.\n\n- Live audio-video connection between the two parties\n- 90 % of calls answered within 30 seconds\n- Add the languages you speak in settings", "artistId":905177578, "artistName":"Be My Eyes", "genres":["Lifestyle", "Utilities"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"org.bemyeyes.BeMyEyes", "version":"3.1.21", "wrapperType":"software", "averageUserRating":4.5, "userRatingCount":4323},
